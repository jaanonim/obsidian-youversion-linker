## Adding new language support

If you want to add support for a new language, you can do so by following these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new file in `data/books` with the name of the language (e.g. `data/books/pl.json`) with books names.
3. Import json file to `src/BooksLists.ts` as shown in the example:

```ts
import pl from "../data/books/pl.json";
```

```ts
// prettier-ignore
const booksNames = {
	// ...
	"Polish": pl,
	// ...
} as BooksLangList;
```

(See the other languages for examples.)

4. Add your name to the list above in this file (`Languages.md`).
5. Create a PR with the changes. Title it `Add {some_languges} book names` for eg: `Add Polish book names`. (I will review it and merge it.)

**Thank you for your contribution!**
